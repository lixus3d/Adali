# ADALI

Adali is a RTS-Game build in javascript. It's just a 2010/2011 training project.

## Demo

You can see a working demo on (http://demo.anorake.net/adali/index.html).

Compatibility :

+ Chrome (quickest)
+ Firefox (with APNG)
+ IE 9+ (no sound?)

_The project is in javascript, so you can test it just with just a browser by downloading the sources._


## Progress

- Astar is working great, but can be better of course.
- The RTS is running in isometric.
- You can build move, attack and construct some vehicules and some structures.
- Ressources are not fully implemented.


## Concept

After seeing (https://github.com/ronlix/webrts), I wanted to do my own RTS engine just for fun.
I'm not working on realtime project usually, so it's kinda a challenge for me.
Actually i'm just planning to do a singleplayer version with all usual RTS features.
