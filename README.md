# ADALI


## Description

Adali is a RTS-Game build in javascript.


## Concept 

After seeing (https://github.com/ronlix/webrts), I wanted to do my own RTS engine just for fun.
I'm not working on realtime project usually, so it's kinda a challenge for me.
Actually i'm just planning to do an singleplayer version with all usual RTS features.

## Demo 

Chrome and Firefox run the projet perfectly. 

+ You can see a working demo on (http://www.adreamaline.com/adali/).
+ The project is in javascript, so you can test it just with a browser by downloading the sources. (ugly index.php block that for now)

_Have fun with and give me some feedbacks please_


## Progress

- Astar is working great, but can be better of course.
- The RTS is running in isometric.
- You can build move, attack and construct __vehicules__ only.
- Ressources are not yet implemented.
- Some french comment maybe, I will try to track them ;)
